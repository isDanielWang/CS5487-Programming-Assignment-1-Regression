From the 'Train size vs. Mean square error,' we could find that the least-square's curve is unstable and goes to low MSE slowest. Regularized's curve is a little more stable than the least-squares, but it still needs more data to get a low MSE than the other three methods.\n",

    "    - Bayesian regression. From the lecture, we know that mean of the estimated parameter theta is the linear combination of the maximum likelihood estimate and the prior. After adding outliers, if the variance of the training data is very large, the mean of theta will be closed to our prior. In other words, our prior is a type of regularization, which improves the model's robustness.\n",
    "    - Robust regression. As robust regression uses absolute to calculate the loss, its loss will be smaller than the method using the square of the difference to measure the loss when the difference between observation and prediction is larger than 1. This feature makes robust regression robust to outliers.\n",
